I am a computer science at CSUF and I expect to graduate in 2027.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
Lab 1
The “Hello World” lab is my favorite lab because it was just an introduction to computer science. It was pretty simple and quick. 

Lab 2 
My second favorite lab is lab 2. We were learning about string. It was simple because we were just trying to do an input and output. 

Lab 3
My third favorite lab is lab 3. We were trying to figure out the BMI of celebrities. I thought it was cool because I can code and figure out and person’s BMI.
